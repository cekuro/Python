This will be an on going log/journal for my efforts to learn python and become proficient at it in all fields. The first step will be to learn Python 3 in its entirety. After learning, I will segway into applying python into my network security field, understanding how I can automate tasks. In the distant future, I'd like to understand applying web development as well as phone app development by expanding into the various python based languages such as Django and kivy.
While I understand the basics of programming and I have taken object oriented classes focusing on Java, I need to fully immserse my studies to fully grasp everything about programming and how to think like an object oriented programmer. I'm going to spend the first couple of weeks reading and researching python.
